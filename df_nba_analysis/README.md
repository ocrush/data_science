## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Standard Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6.7 along with Pulp 2.3. conda install -c conda-forge pulp.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in analyzing daily FanDuel data to better understand:

1. Compare fantasy points by positions (pg,sg,sf,pf,c's) to see if one group is better than other?
2. Which position performs well for high,mid,low-end salary?
3. How does playing away change scoring or other stats for a player?
4. What is the best possible lineup, total points, pts/$1000's, and cost of lineup for each day?
5. What does playing optimally everyday show?  Any strategies, trends, etc that we can learn?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional `.py` file that use the pulp to find the best possible lineup for each day.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jsingh63/how-do-you-win-daily-fantasy-basketball-contests-da3e21a58b6b).
